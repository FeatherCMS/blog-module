            <h2>Let's get started</h2>
            <p>Feather is an <b>experimental open source CMS</b> written in Swift using the Vapor framework. Feather is designed for the people who are looking for a fast, minimalistic, simple and elegant little place in the chaotic world of the modern web. Feather provides you a <b>SEO friendly</b>, mobile first frontend which is <b>100% JavaScript FREE</b>, still you can customize the entire look of the website by writing some basic HTML & CSS. Editors can easily maintain the contents of all the pages (including meta information) by using the web-based responsive <b>admin interface</b>. Developers can utilize the built-in <b>JSON based REST API</b> layer and they can extend the system through modules and dynamic hook functions if they want to go beyond the basics... üöÄ</p>

            <h2>Current status</h2>
            
            <p>The version of Feather is a very <b>early release</b> (developers might call it alpha version), you can use this version to play with the system, you could even run this in a production environment, I'm doing the same with my blog, but still it'll take some time to reach the first stable release.</p>
            <p>This is what you can do right now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>üî® Dynamically hook-up pages using SEO friendly routes</li>
                <li>üìò Write blog posts, categorize them and publish under various authors profiles</li>
                <li>‚öôÔ∏è Define system variables to display content based on those</li>
                <li>‚û°Ô∏è Set up redirect rules if you need to migrate content</li>
                <li>üß® Display sponsorship boxes under blog posts or pages</li>
                <li>üôà Build custom templates based on your own needs</li>

                <li>‚úÖ Manage all above using the CMS interface</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Menu module - dynamic menu items and locations</li>

                <li>Visual content editor - VCE</li>
                <li>Dynamic module loader and improved module lifecycle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feather was created by one person, so if you feel like that you could help with some of the features I described above, please don't hesitate to submit a new pull request on GitHub. </p>

            <h2>...a little back-story</h2>
            <p>Feather was born about <b>10 years ago</b> written in PHP5, when two university student decided to build a modular content management system for their web-based side projects. The original name of the project was <b>entropy-framework</b> and it worked surprisingly well, but the authors were developers, so they had no idea how to run a marketing campaign or get investment for such a project. ü§ì</p>
            <p>Time has passed and the project was slowly forgotten, but the original developers gained so much from this experiment. They learned how to communicate and work together and most importantly how to build simple, but well-structured modular, scalable applications. Unfortunately they both moved away from the web for quite a long time...</p>
            <p>Ten years later, it just happened that <a href="https://twitter.com/tiborbodecs">Tibor B√∂decs</a>, one of the original authors of entropy, decided to build a custom blog engine to upgrade his site: <a href="https://theswiftdev.com" target="_blank">The.Swift.Dev</a>. He was an iOS developer for a very long time, he wanted to create a familiar system with modern technologies. He made a plan. First he recreated his blog, written in Swift using Vapor 4, then he published a book about the entire process. It is called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/practical-server-side-swift" target="_blank">Practical Server Side Swift</a> and you can purchase it if you want to learn more about backend apps written in Swift. The next step was to release the underlying engine. ü¶ö</p>
